        It soon became apparent that it was just going to be a question of how many goals Tottenham would score as
        Gareth Bale’s dipping free-kick was scooped away by goalkeeper Plamen Iliev and Moura missed from close range.
        Moura made up for that squandered chance moments later when Bale played Kane in down the right and the striker
        claimed another assist as he rolled a perfect pass across goal that Moura finished easily from three yards out.

        Mourinho decided to replace Kane at half-time with one eye on the trip to West Brom on Sunday but the manager
        might have regretted that after Keseru reduced Ludogorets’ deficit four minutes after the restart with one of
        their first forays into Tottenham territory. He was in the right position to turn home from close range after
        Bernard Tekpetey’s shot was deflected into his path.Kane’s replacement, Carlos Vinicius, who is still settling
        in following his move from Benfica, should have opened his account when Lo Celso pulled the ball back to him,
        but he blazed over.

        Mourinho sent Son on just after the hour and he needed only 17 seconds to make an impact as he teed up Lo Celso
        to grab a deserved goal after bossing things from midfield.
