*A Tour of the Mouths of Château Rouge*

It's Sunday, 27th of October, 2019 and I've just seen my breath for the first time this year. I do it again, this time pulling deeper into my lungs.

[…]
 
There it is, momentarily masking my vision. I look up. My eye caught by the opaque green glow of the luminous pharmacy sign. ‘7° C’ it says, wrapped up in fog. Animating and transitioning ‘12:21’ it says, mirroring the action. Symmetrically parked either side of a blinking colon. Inhale. Exhale. ‘12:21’ I say aloud.

Disfigured bollards and Haussmannian building blocks flank either side of the cobbled street. Stepping left and right, slaloming between bystanders, market goers and the such like. The smell of fresh meat permeates across the street, I can almost taste it. The sounds of butchers grinding bones and fruit sellers in full song. The delivery men are calling for order and the discrete
mutterings of back-street city hustlers continue. Sirens cry-out like whale song and an organ of car horns sound out from the congestion ahead. The line of vehicles harmonise momentarily, the driver nearest to me throws up his arms in dismay, and in turn looks somewhat like the composer of this almighty orchestra.

Cardboard boxes and empty fruit crates have been assembled and propped-up to form pedestals of exchange. The makeshift urban furnitures stand temporarily unoccupied and undecorated of goods. A sign that the police have only moments ago made their unannounced daily sweep of the unlicensed traders. I step off the curb, slipping between bumpers—a car pulls past up the one-way street, clearing out the disorder ahead—trailing behind catching the slipstream in its wake, I traverse up-street. Skipping the crowd who've briefly been washed-up onto the side-walk. Black bin bags sit
aside front doors interrupting the pedestrians path like rotund full stops lodged in text.

The *bouches de lavage* gargles up from within and babbles out in public. From gut to gutter. Purling past the collected debris with the water racing downstream to the base of the street. Here on Chicken Street, the mouths are open all day, as is the market; full flow seven days a week.
