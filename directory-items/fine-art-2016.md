Camberwell’s Fine Art programme is a set of four unique courses — in Drawing, Painting, Photography and Sculpture — which each equip students with a foundation built around specific histories, skills and traditions to question how contemporary art in all its forms is made, is understood, and is relevant to the contemporary world. —  Introduction excerpt

The monoprints were produced over a series of workshops with the Painting department at Camberwell College of Art. Four unique, painted prints are bound into each publication.
