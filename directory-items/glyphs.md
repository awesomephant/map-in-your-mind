*Glyph(s)*

A series of site-specific sculptural typographies, consisting of both made and found street furnitures. Conceived during a residency at the Hoffmitz Milken Center for Typography. 

A column support divides the path in one of two directions; traversing one way is an industrially produced steel bike-rack, which steers you away from the walls edge. Along the far wall, a heavy-duty steel fence encourages you to step forward. At the centre, a concrete road block stops you dead.

The glyphs consider their likeness to syntax systems. Familiar street furnitures revealing themselves as embodied punctuative marks; be it a comma or connector between spaces and on occasion a more forcible physical delay. Breaking. Pausing. Stopping. Choreographing the flow through rooms.
