*Glyph(s)* is a series of site-specific sculptural typographies, consisting of both made and found street furnitures. A carefully positioned column support divides your path in one of two directions; traversing one way you encounter an industrially produced steel bike-rack, which steers you away from the walls edge into the space (above right). Along the far wall, a heavy-duty steel fence encourages you to step forward between works. Towards the centre, a concrete road block stops you dead. 

The projects conception began with a series of field recordings gathering together a topology of ‘stops’ deployed in the locally built environment. Drawing from the circulation patterns of the street, the glyphs consider their likeness to syntax systems. Whilst bridging the inside-outside space, the familiar street furnitures reveal themselves as embodied punctuative marks; be it a comma or connector between spaces, or more forcibly an instruction for physical delay breaking. pausing. stopping. choreographing the flow through rooms.
