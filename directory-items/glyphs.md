Glyph(s) is a series of site-specific sculptural typographies, consisting of both made and found street furnitures. A carefully positioned column support divides the visitors path into one of two directions; traversing right the visitor encounters an industrially produced steel bike-rack, steering them away from the walls edge. Along the far wall, a heavy-duty steel fence encourages the visitor to step forward between works, then meeting in the centre a concrete road block stops you dead. 
	The project’s conception began with a series of field recordings, gathering together a typology of ‘barriers’ deployed in the locally built environment. Drawing from the circulation patterns of the street; the glyphs consider their likeness to syntax systems. Whilst bridging the inside-outside space, the street furnitures reveal themselves as embodied punctuative marks; be it a comma or connector between spaces, or more forcibly an instruction for physical delay; breaking, pausing, stopping and choreographing movement.
