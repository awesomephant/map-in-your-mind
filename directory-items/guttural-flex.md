Guttural Flex was an intervention arranged site-specifically for the Werkplaats Typografie (Arnhem, NL) building. Comprising of five steel sculptural typographies, the forms reveal themselves as a succession of contorted limb-like handrails; choreographing and guiding incomers with a newly shaped dialect for the flow through rooms. 

The process of production begins by firing the steel tube until a pliable orange glow emerges, then directly hand-bending a series of manipulations. The flesh coloured rails refrain from depicting letters but rather, are seen to be letter-like given meaning reciprocally, through a process of interaction. Read from Aâ€”B and back again, the articulated path of guttural-splurges begins with a more recognisable handrail situated outside of the building, easing one up the stairs in through the foyer.
