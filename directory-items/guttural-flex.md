*Guttural Flex*

An intervention arranged site-specifically for the Werkplaats Typografie building. Comprising of five steel sculptural typographies, the forms reveal themselves as a succession of contorted limb-like handrails; choreographing incomers with a newly shaped dialect for the rooms.

The process of production begins by firing the skin of the steel tube until a pliable orange glow emerges, then directly hand-writing a series of manipulations. A language read from Aâ€”B and back again; the articulated path of guttural-splurges starts with a more recognisable handrail situated on the outside of the building, easing one up the stairs in through the foyer leading down to the exhibition space, situated in the basement of the building. <br><br>
