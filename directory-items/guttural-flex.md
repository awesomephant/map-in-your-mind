Guttural Flex was an intervention designed and arranged site-specifically for the Werkplaats Typografie building. Comprising of five steel sculptures the forms reveal themselves as a succession of contorted limb-like handrails; choreographing and guiding incomers with a newly shaped apprehension of the space.

The process of producing the forms begin with the industrial standard six meter steel tube, fired using a blowtorch until a pliable and malleable state, then a series of hand-bent, handwritten folds. In colour and form, the folded steel mimics that of flesh. The rails in themselves refrain from depicting letters but rather, are seen to be letter-like given meaning reciprocallyâ€”through a process of interaction like words of a sentence. From the more recognisable handrail easing one up the stairs to the more unpredictable forms in the basement area.
