*The Stones of Bourges*

[...] With the absence of word my eyes not ears pricked up. My hunch was that the French language had in someway materialised itself more so in the body. This observation was relatively short lived. I concluded that my awareness had merely elevated due to my verbal ineptitude. But upon my arrival I couldn’t help but notice the routing of word in gesture; whether it be in the raising of an eyebrow or the shrugging of shoulders. The multitude of neck movements alone seemed to implicate an assortment of signification I had since overlooked. 

My awareness heightened too to those inter-punctual noises, noting their ability to talk, and clearly talk they do. Not quite assigned to a given language, it sits somewhere in the in-between. The emboldened punctuation marks of every day speech, sounds of which words have yet to be fully attributed. In other words those gasps of breath or the diverse delivery of huffs and puffs, the groans, the sighs; those well timed signals we impart with and release during speech. All of which incidentally make a mockery of the printed punctuation mark, however well placed. It was the variety of meaning which became so apparent; after first noting the sigh of doubt, I began to make a list of the various iterations; the exasperating long winded sigh of frustration, the confessional sigh of guilt, the pain reflex, the pleasure reflex, the satisfactory sigh of relief, of disappointment and not least exhaustion. Was this where word began? Harnessed somewhere in-between the realm of the emotional and the physical? So accustomed to these automatisms in daily life—I had turned a blind eye to their significance.
