It was the first time I sensed it, like a tooth
filling beginning to dislodge In a bid to moderate
the niggling nuisance, I wriggled my toes encouraging
it to fall from position. The meandering streets
formed a steep incline, prompting the stones next
movement, rolling wayward, tumbling somewhere down
towards the heel. As my foot met the freshly laid
soft black tarmac, the stone had re-orientated round
during it’s journey from front to back, kissing my
heel with it’s newly found confidence. Reluctant of
breaking stride, temporarily I allowed my foot to fall
limp, nose down trying to tempt the shrapnel to roll
back under the arch to it’s more manageable resting
place. I brought my right foot down once more, to only
clamp the stone between the ball of my foot and the
sole of my shoe. Subsequently piercing my most
recently matured penny-sized blister. I widened my
mouth, gritted my teeth and exhaled a pointed gasp
of discomfort in the direction of the stone. After
being brought to a standstill, I raised my leg back
up from the ground, once more allowing my foot to fall
limp, however this time following it up with a quick
kick of the leg. Finally it had made it’s way back up
to the toe-end I plodded along on the tip-toes of my
right foot. Following the ring road round, back past
through the pedestrian filters; street bollards
followed by zebra crossings, traffic lights and speed
bumps. The cities pacemakers were in full flow,
orchestrating the afternoon rush hour. Approaching
the oncoming traffic congestion at the tube exit, I
took a sharp left turn down a back alley passageway
between or behind buildings.
