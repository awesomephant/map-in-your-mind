Measuring systems which proceeded the meter were often drawn directly from the body; feet, inches, paces etcetera — the problem being the accuracy of which would differ from place to place. The meter on the other hand, was a rather utopian ideal, a measure taken from the earth itself brought into existence to unite communities and not least provide clarity to the fluctuating measures set before.

A Glib Remark, A Fragment or Unfinished Phrase started with a system devised to form unmade and unnamed glyphs. The resequenced alphabet was conceived using a single steel meter bar; leaving dexterous, durational traces held from one manipulation to the next. First the bar is fired using a blowtorch, then hand-shaped into signs. The project displays a primary, concrete struggle with language, breaking down the physicality of letterforms. Wrestling to form identifiable glyphs; shaping them, pulling them apart and putting them back together.
