<br>Into the Fold was a project which questioned the ideology of 'the studio', materialising in the form of an exhibition and publication through a temporary and spontaneous community of practice. 

Curated by Marios Stamatis and James Edgar; Into the Fold brought together a diverse range of emerging and established creative practitioners and thinkers from art and design. 

Events and workshops by: Laure Prouvost, Europa, Mattia Giussani, Sam Jones, Christopher Lacy, Vanessa Periam, Flaminia Rossi, Eilis Searson, Oliver Boulton, Caz Slattery, Harry Stayt, Konstantinos Trichas and Edgar-Walker.
