Measuring systems proceeding the meter were often derived from the human body: feet, inches, paces etcetera. Problems would often occur with inaccuracies, differing from place to place, community to community. On the other hand, the meter was a rather utopian ideal; a measure taken from the earth itself. Established to unite, clarify and alleviate any discontinuity.

*A Glib Remark, A Fragment or Unfinished Phrase* began as a proposed re-sequencing of the Latin alphabet based on the physicality between forms, an enquiry into where a letter starts and ends. Conceived using a single steel meter; first the bar was fired using a blowtorch, then hand-shaped into a string of signs leaving dexterous, hand-written, durational traces from one manipulation to the next. Between handwriting forms; unnamed letter-likes are revealed, letters within letters, letters between letters. The process endured was a raw primary, concrete struggle with language. Wrestling with definition and the construction of identifiable signs; shaping, pulling them apart and putting them back together.
