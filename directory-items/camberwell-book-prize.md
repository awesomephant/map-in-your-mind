The Camberwell Book Prize was founded in 2017 to support emerging graduates from the Photography programme at Camberwell College of Arts, University of the Arts London. The project supports a proposal for an experimentally orientated publication, through a series of workshops, design consultation and production budget. It aims to contribute to the evolving research and ideas around artistsâ€™ books and to support ambitious graduates in seeking audiences for their practices. The project was initiated by Duncan Wooldridge and Sigune Hamann.
