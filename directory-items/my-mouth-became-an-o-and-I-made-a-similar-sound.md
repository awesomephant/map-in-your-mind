**My Mouth Became an ‘O’ and I Made a Similar Sound**

I struggle to read when someone is talking. When the words I'm reading jar towards the words I'm hearing. When the words I'm hearing hit me as hard as the words I'm reading. I find myself having to give voice to the words; sounding them back to myself as I read or write. Like many I find it difficult to fully digest or compose them under such circumstance, when an unchosen flutter of voices reach and interrupt me. By relaying the words back to myself helps give shape to my conversation; and by my own admission drown out the potentially more interesting conversations in the room.

7th April 2019 <br>
Sitting alone in the living room of my one bedroom apartment, I began reading the final chapter of my book. As I reached the end of the first sentence, a pile-driver began to pulse. The vibrations sounding across my entire space; reverberating the floor boards, shivering each of the ten walls that shape my living quarters; the open-plan living room and adjoining kitchen, positioned between a separate bedroom and bathroom.

I left the living room for the bedroom in seek of refuge from the drumming; for it to make next to no difference. In a momentary bid of stubbornness I sat on the edge of my bed trying to focus; to ignore the pounding and to block out the noise, but this effort was short lived. Focus I could not. The words wouldn't sit with me. Even as I read them aloud I struggled. Words written or spoken demand a certain type of silence to be heard and I couldn't hear myself think. Forced out of my private dwelling I left in a huff and took a walk down to my nearest park, passing by the voluptuous hustle and bustle of Chateau Rouge. Navigating past the human traffic flow of the tube exit; checking the tumultuous bike lane; then waiting for the green figure to signal me across the road. I took an uphill walk to Montmartre, after finding an empty bench I sat amongst the chattering of tourists and the chirping of birdsong. 

Upon reaching the final full stop of my book, I made my way home and began thinking of silence and its curious relationship between public and private spaces; what is expected of us in these spaces and in exchange what do we expect. How do the architectural patterns modulate our patterns of speech?
