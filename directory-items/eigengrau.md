EIGENGRAU.‘Own Grey’; also called ‘eigenlicht’ (‘own light’), dark light, or brain grey, is the uniform dark grey background that many people report seeing in the absence of light. The term ‘eigenlicht’ dates back to the nineteenth century, but has rarely been used in recent scientific publications. Nowadays, the phenomenon is more commonly referred to as ‘visual noise’ or ‘background adaptation’. ‘Eigengrau’ is perceived as lighter than back under normal lighting conditions, because contrast is more important to the visual system than absolute brightness for example, the night sky looks darker than ‘eigengrau’ because of the contrast provided by the stars.—introduction excerpt
