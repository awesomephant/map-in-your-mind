[...] The phenomenon of the positive afterimage is created when a person, standing in a dark space, experiences a sudden and short flash of light. This results in a ‘positive’ afterimage of whatever the person was looking at during the time the flash went off. This image is ephemeral in the sense that it dissipates within seconds of being created but at the same it creates a memory, we can relive that image only in our minds. Studying this afterimage becomes an exercise in studying its effects, its lingering traces on the people that experienced them. — Introduction excerpt
