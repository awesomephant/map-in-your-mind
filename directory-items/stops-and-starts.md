*Stops & Stars, Blurb*

[...] There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not.¹ All of them are traffic signals; in the last analysis, traffic signals were modelled on them. Exclamation points are red, colons green, dashes call a halt.² Like words, places are articulated by a thousand usages.³ They are components of a space, because they are similar to building elements, they can always be rearranged into new combinations or positions, thereby altering space.⁴ The movement between rooms, the circulation space, may be generous or mean.⁵ The door breaks space in two, splits it, prevents osmosis, imposes a partition.⁶<br><br>
