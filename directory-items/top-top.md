[...] The book comes in a utilitarian brown card sleeve, and a similar pared-down approach continues inside in the book. The reader opens the sleeve by pulling at a tab, which runs in perforated lines across both ends of the sleeve, similar to the opening of a cereal packet. This is the first decision the reader takes in encountering the book – which end is the top? The book has two spines, so it can be flipped over and the reader can start again – a book that promises only beginnings, and no ends. The two parts are similar but not the same, demanding closer inspection, disorienting the reader’s first impressions. There are no words, only black and white images of objects alone or with anonymous hands using them. The images, of mundane items such as wristwatches, pencils and doorbells, play with their use and usefulness, subverting their typical functionality.

[...] A phone receiver is held upside down, a silent ear to a silent mouthpiece. A scenic postcard, upside down. A shrinking balloon, hanging upside down. Apart from examining the objects photographed, the publication poses wider questions about books and images and the manner in which we look at something familiar. Somehow Magritte echoes here, with objects dryly observed and disrupted at the same time. Top/Top reads like an instruction manual to surreal. — Reviewed by Riikka Kuittinen, Photomonitor, 2015.
