The publication accompanies the opening of Pentagon Petal. This installation project by artist Fran Cottell and architect Marianne Mueller reflects on the Rootstein Hopkins Parade Ground as the dream site for Jeremy Bentham’s experimental panopticon, the real Millbank Penitentiary, a military parade ground and now university campus, outdoor gallery and thoroughfare to Tate Britain.

From solitary confinement, to the military organisation of a group as a single unit to today’s neoliberal forms of sociability, the social history of the Rootstein Hopkins Parade Ground represents a cross section through architecture’s power to orchestrate social modes.

Titling typeset in Caslon Egyptian, lent by John Morgan Studio. A digital interpretation of the first acknowledged sans serif typeface designed in 1816, the same year the Millbank Prison took its first prisoners.
